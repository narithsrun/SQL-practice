(Learning basic/intermediate SQL by solving a crime game)



select *
from crime_scene_report
where date = 20180115
              
              
this shows us whos at the crime scene at which date

from there it tells us there are 2 witness
- 1 lives at last house on "Northwestern Dr"
- 2nd name "Annabel" live somewhere on "Franklin Ave"

Select *
from person
where address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr"
order by address_number DESC
              
this shows us the first suspect who lives at the last house on northwestern dr

id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
14887	Morty Schapiro	118009	4919	Northwestern Dr	111564949

next suspect we just run this query search

select *
from person
where address_street_name = "Franklin Ave" AND name = "Annabel"

id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
16371	Annabel Miller	490173	103	Franklin Ave	318771143

we then can look at what they have to say at their interview

select*
from interview
where person_id = 14887

"I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". 
Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W"." - morty

"I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th." - annabel


so i first scan gym membership with the bag id 48Z and got 2 results

id	person_id	name	membership_start_date	membership_status
48Z7A	28819	Joe Germuska	20160305	gold
48Z55	67318	Jeremy Bowers	20160101	gold

now lets check two and see who has a car plate with "h42w"

id	age	height	eye_color	hair_color	gender	plate_number	car_make	car_model
423327	30	70	brown	brown	male	0H42W2	Chevrolet	Spark LS

we have pinpointed that Jeremy is currently the suspect but lets see what he has to saw during the interview

person_id	transcript
67318	I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017. 

now we need to find a women who drives a tesla model s and has a lot of money

Select *
from drivers_license
where car_model = "Model S" AND gender = 'female' AND hair_color = 'red'

id	age	height	eye_color	hair_color	gender	plate_number	car_make	car_model
202298	68	66	green	red	female	500123	Tesla	Model S
291182	65	66	blue	red	female	08CM64	Tesla	Model S
918773	48	65	black	red	female	917UU3	Tesla	Model S


now we use this info to see which one of them has a lot of money

id	name	license_id	address_number	address_street_name	ssn
99716	Miranda Priestly	202298	1883	Golden Ave	987756388
90700	Regina George	291182	332	Maple Ave	337169072
78881	Red Korb	918773	107	Camerata Dr	961388910

ssn	annual_income
987756388	310000
961388910	278000

seems that miranda has the highest income and after looking around, I could not find anything else so i decided to submit her as a result 

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
        
        SELECT value FROM solution;


Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. Time to break out the champagne!

yay we beat it
